## Lab 2: The Reading List - Python Dictionary (40 mins)

- Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

- Create a list of dictionaries, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

- Iterate through the list of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so:

``` "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".```

- Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. 

- If you read it, log a string like

```'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien'```, 

- and if not, log a string like

```'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.```
